# Bored?
### It's a virtual room full of Ideas when you're BORED!


## Features

- This website contains three modest pages 
- BoredRoom which is the main page, Feelings and Remember me!
- Two of three pages retrieve the information in real-time from API's 

## What do they do?

### BoredRoom
This page is designed to generate ideas for your free time to think about when you want to do something productive. The button provided here is reading and translating the data from [BoredAPI](https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity) and generates unique ideas.

### Feelings
This page is designed to retrieve the picture of the day and a brief explanation about the picture from NASA API. The button provided here is reading and translating the data from [NasaAPI](https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY).

### RememberMe!
This page is designed as a form for a person to write the memories, wishes or etc. and it will use JavaScript functions to submit and resend it in one year. This form is using three functions for counting down a timer for a year and the other one to resubmit the form when countdown timer is finished and one which is showing date and time on the form. It will return a pop-up window when the submission is done and return the days left on the buttom of the form after. Also there is an API used in this website that fetches the names of the countries and shows them as a drop-down list.


# Design

This website is designed to express the feeling of relaxation.
In the first part, there is a navigation bar (all other three pages have the same nav-bar) that I customized completely using bootstrap classes and embedded style css classes. It has different parts such as logo design that uses a random JS function to get the colors generated from color generator function, and three other parts which are the pages names that showed minimally there.
In the footer, there is a link refrenced to the creator of the art on the background of each page.


# Codes borrowed 
I borrowed the code from this website[RandomColorApi](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-background-colors-javascript--cms-37030) to generate the random color for "the Bored?" logo.
Also [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/).


# Further content if I had time

If I had more time I would work on the form page, I think the contents are not enough and the functionality would be different than what it is now. I would like to use a database for that to store the data and resubmit the form after one year.

# Issues

Just two things to add here are firstly, I had three background videos and because of the size of the files I couldn't submit it, so I had to compress the videos and use one video instead of three (I also have a backup image background if while the video is loading if the network is low) and other one is that I tried multiple times to separate the JS functions from the HTML files but every time the React imports weren't working and I couldn't fetch the data.

# Feedback

I really enjoy working with JavaScript, and I've learned so much related to the functionality of the web apps, but I wish we had more time on this class to learn more, because there are grey spaces remaining still on what I have learned and I think I have a long way to the point that I can say I KNOW JavaScript.  I wish it wouldn't be a problem because I tried my best to hand it on time. I want to say Thank you Brandon for everything you taught me, there is absolutely NO complaint.
